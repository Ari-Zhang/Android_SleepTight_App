### Background
This project builds on the idea of the impact of sleep quality on mental alertness and stress level. KTH/SU will run a research project called “Sömn i vardagen” which will have hundreds of participants from different demographics and age groups.
This application is dedicated for exploring the impact that sleep quality has on mental alertness and stress levels.
Materials using in this project, including two questionnaires and a Visuospatial Working Memory task are provided by the research program.

### Description
We used Android Studio to code our app using java. This project aims to research, design and complete an Android application that can help with the research program Sömn i vardage to collect data from volunteers. We also need to design a Visuospatial Working Memory (VWM) task as the cognitive test to measure volunteer's mental alertness.
